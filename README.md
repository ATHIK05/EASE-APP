# WasteWise India - Comprehensive Waste Management Platform

## Overview
WasteWise India is a comprehensive digital platform designed to transform India's waste management system through mandatory citizen training, community participation, and decentralized monitoring. The platform addresses the critical gap where only 54% of India's 1.7 lakh tonnes of daily municipal solid waste is scientifically treated.
